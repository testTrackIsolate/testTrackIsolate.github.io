<p class="body">(Honestly, why did it have to be our turn when this happened? You'd already had a tory government for ten years, for God's sake! We'd run down absolutely everything, diverting profits to our backers, and judging it just right so that in 2024 we could hand over to Labour a <span class="emphasis">broken husk</span> of a country and let them take the blame for ruining it as they start to undo our damage, so we could step back in.</p><p class="body">But this is harrowing stuff. We wouldn't be human if we weren't in denial about destroying the UK's capacity to cope with a pandemic, and just being too generally useless to protect care home residents or control the spread of disease.</p><p class="body">Yet somehow, we're still just about getting away with it. We'll blame the scientists, we'll blame Labour if we possibly can, and in the end, <span class="emphasis">we'll blame you</span>.)</p>
